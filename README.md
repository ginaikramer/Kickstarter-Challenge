# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze Kickstarter Campaign data to make recommendations to my client, Louise, for future fundraising initiatives. Louise's fundraising campaign for her play, Fever, came close to her goal in a short amount of time. For her next campaign, Louise is interested to learn if and how the launch date of a campaign affects the outcome of its fundraising goal. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- One of the challenges I faced when creating the 'Theater Outcomes by Launch Date' deliverable was converting the launched_at column into a user-friendly formatted date value.
  - I overcame this challenge by creating two new columns â€“ one to hold the full converted date and one to hold only the converted year. I applied the Unix to Date conversion    formula within the first new column and then used the @Year function for the second. While I could have just created one new column, I wanted to visually see the full date for possible further analysis. 
- One of the challenges I faced when creating the 'Outcomes Based on Goals' deliverable was when I attempted to create the visual line graph.
  - When I created the line graph off of the table I created, the Y axis displayed a different data point than the one I wanted (percentages). 
  - I overcame this by right-clicking on the line graph and choosing Select Data to edit what displays on the Y axis.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
